      "My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal. This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring. A spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America. When our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world, and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change. Not change for change sake, but change to preserve America's ideals: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless. Each generation of American's must define what it means to be an American. On behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America and I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism and communism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom, but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues. Raised in unrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep divisions among our own people.\n",
      "\n",
      "When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news travelled slowly across the land by horseback, and across the ocean by boat. Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously tobillions around the world. Communications and commerce are global. Investment is mobile. Technology is almost magical, and ambition for a better life is now universal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth. Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy. This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it. But when most people are working harder for less, when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so. Instead we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence. Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people, and we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us. From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil Rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history. Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time. Let us embrace it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "To renew America we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do before. We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity. It will not be easy. It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and done fairly. Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children. Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We can do no less. Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is. Posterity is the world to come, the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibilities. We must do what America does best, offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing: from our government, or from each other. Let us all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our communities and our country. To renew America we must revitalize our democracy. This beautiful capitol, like every capitol since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation. Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are people who want to do better, and so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to reform our politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put aside personal advantage, so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America. Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called \"bold, persistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays.\" Let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it belongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at home. There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic. The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all. Today as an old order passes, the new world is more free, but less stable. Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities, and new dangers. Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make. While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with our friends and allies, we will work together to shape change, lest it engulf us. When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act; with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary. The brave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve, but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands. Across the world, we see them embraced and we rejoice. Our hopes, our hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause. The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes in historic numbers, you have changed the face of congress, the presidency, and the political process itself. Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring. Now WE must do the work the season demands. To that work I now turn with ALL the authority of my office. I ask the congress to join with me; but no president, no congress, no government can undertake THIS mission alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal. I challenge a new generation of YOUNG Americans to a season of service, to act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is so much to be done. Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit, to give of themselves in service, too. In serving we recognize a simple, but powerful, truth: we need each other, and we must care for one another. Today we do more than celebrate America, we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution, and renewed through two centuries of challenge, an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate, we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity, the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's journey long, heroic journey must go forever upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st Century, let us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and let us work until our work is done. The Scripture says: \"And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley. We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the guard, and now each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, and God bless you all.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "My fellow citizens: At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century. It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs -- a moment that will define our course, and our character, for decades to come. We must keep our old democracy forever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise. \n",
      "\n",
      "The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal. It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century. \n",
      "\n",
      "And what a century it has been. America became the world's mightiest industrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose. We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast. We began the 20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency. Those choices made all the difference. At the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect union. \n",
      "\n",
      "When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today. We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation. Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth. Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment. Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work. \n",
      "\n",
      "And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government. Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. We -- the American people -- we are the solution. Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day. \n",
      "\n",
      "As times change, so government must change. We need a new government for a new century -- humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less. Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less. The preeminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity -- not a guarantee, but a real opportunity -- to build better lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship. And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century. There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls; coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility -- not only for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation. Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century. For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America. \n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future -- will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not? Will we all come together, or come apart? \n",
      "\n",
      "The divide of race has been America's constant curse. And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different. These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past. They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror. And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become. We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere. We shall overcome them. And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st century. Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together. \n",
      "\n",
      "As this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines. Ten years ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren. Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life. Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps. Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries. Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over. And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy? To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding \"Yes.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the heart of our task. With a new vision of government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey. The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession. Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy. And the doors of higher education will be open to all. The knowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just of the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child. Parents and children will have time not only to work, but to read and play together. And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college, \n",
      "\n",
      "Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone who can work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of tomorrow's growing middle class. New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and hardworking families too long denied. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction. Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas. And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations -- a nation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its values. A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time. A nation that fortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land. \n",
      "\n",
      "And in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests -- regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens. Prosperity and power -- yes, they are important, and we must maintain them. But let us never forget: The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest progress we have yet to make, is in the human heart. In the end, all the world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation. Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart. Martin Luther King's dream was the American Dream. His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed. Our history has been built on such dreams and labors. And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century. \n",
      "\n",
      "To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office. I ask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge. The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another. Surely, they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore. No, they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with America's mission. \n",
      "\n",
      "America demands and deserves big things from us -- and nothing big ever came from being small. Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin, when facing the end of his own life. He said: \"It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on acrimony and division.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For all of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too, will come to an end. But the journey of our America must go on. \n",
      "\n",
      "And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to dare. The demands of our time are great and they are different. Let us meet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful and happy heart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history. Yes, let us build our bridge. A bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise. \n",
      "\n",
      "May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American Dream alive for all her children; with the American promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people; with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth. May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead -- and always, always bless our America. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a place, all of us, in a long story--a story we continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the American story--a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals. \n",
      "\n",
      "The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born. \n",
      "\n",
      "Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel. \n",
      "\n",
      "While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country. \n",
      "\n",
      "We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.\n",
      "\n",
      "America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character. \n",
      "\n",
      "America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment. \n",
      "\n",
      "America, at its best, is also courageous. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations. \n",
      "\n",

I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.\n",
      "  At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical¡Xand then there came a day of fire.\n",
      "  We have seen our vulnerability¡Xand we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny¡Xprone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder¡Xviolence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.\n",
      "  We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.\n",
      "  America¡¦s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation¡¦s security, and the calling of our time.\n",
      "  So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\n",
      "  This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.\n",
      "  The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America¡¦s influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America¡¦s influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom¡¦s cause.\n",
      "  My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America¡¦s resolve, and have found it firm.\n",
      "  We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.\n",
      "  We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America¡¦s belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.\n",
      "  Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty¡Xthough this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it.\n",
      "  Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:\n",
      "  All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.\n",
      "  Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country.\n",
      "  The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ¡§Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.¡¨\n",
      "  The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.\n",
      "  And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom¡¦s enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies¡¦ defeat.\n",
      "  Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:\n",
      "  From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well¡Xa fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.\n",
      "  A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause¡Xin the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ¡K the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ¡K the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives¡Xand we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.\n",
      "  All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself¡Xand in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.\n",
      "  America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home¡Xthe unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.\n",
      "  In America¡¦s ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance¡Xpreparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.\n",
      "  In America¡¦s ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character¡Xon integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before¡Xideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n",
      "  In America¡¦s ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.\n",
      "  From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause?\n",
      "  These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes¡Xand I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free.\n",
      "  We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ¡§Freedom Now¡¨¡Xthey were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.\n",
      "  When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ¡§It rang as if it meant something.¡¨ In our time it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength¡Xtested, but not weary¡Xwe are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.\n",

      "\n",
      "So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.\n",
      "\n",

      "On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.\n",

      "\n",
      "We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things'some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.\n",
      "\n",
      "For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.\n",
      "\n",
      "For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control -- the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.\n",
      "\n",
      "For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.\n",
      "\n",
      "For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.\n",
      "\n",
      " Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet ... it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "America! In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.\n",

of happiness.\", 'Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless.', \"Each generation of American's must define what it means to be an American.\", 'On behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America and I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism and communism.', 'Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom, but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.', \"Raised in unrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep divisions among our own people.\", 'When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news travelled slowly across the land by horseback, and across the ocean by boat.', 'Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously tobillions around the world.', 'Communications and commerce are global.', 'Investment is mobile.', 'Technology is almost magical, and ambition for a better life is now universal.', 'We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth.', 'Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.', 'This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it.', 'But when most people are working harder for less, when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.', 'We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so.', 'Instead we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.', 'Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths.', 'Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people, and we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us.', 'From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil Rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.', 'Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time.', 'Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time.', 'Let us embrace it.', 'Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal.', 'There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.', 'And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun.', 'To renew America we must be bold.', 'We must do what no generation has had to do before.', 'We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.', 'It will not be easy.', 'It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and done fairly.', 'Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake.', 'We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children.', 'Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity.', 'We can do no less.', \"Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is.\", 'Posterity is the world to come, the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibilities.', 'We must do what America does best, offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.', 'It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing: from our government, or from each other.', 'Let us all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our communities and our country.', 'To renew America we must revitalize our democracy.', 'This beautiful capitol, like every capitol since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation.', 'Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way.', 'Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are people who want to do better, and so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to reform our politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.', 'Let us put aside personal advantage, so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America.', 'Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called \"bold, persistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays.\"', 'Let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it belongs.', 'To renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at home.', 'There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic.', 'The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all.', 'Today as an old order passes, the new world is more free, but less stable.', \"Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities, and new dangers.\", 'Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.', 'While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world.', 'Together with our friends and allies, we will work together to shape change, lest it engulf us.', 'When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act; with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.', 'The brave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve, but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands.', 'Across the world, we see them embraced and we rejoice.', 'Our hopes, our hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are building democracy and freedom.', \"Their cause is America's cause.\", 'The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today.', 'You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes in historic numbers, you have changed the face of congress, the presidency, and the political process itself.', 'Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.', 'Now WE must do the work the season demands.', 'To that work I now turn with ALL the authority of my office.', 'I ask the congress to join with me; but no president, no congress, no government can undertake THIS mission alone.', 'My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.', 'I challenge a new generation of YOUNG Americans to a season of service, to act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.', 'There is so much to be done.', 'Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit, to give of themselves in service, too.', 'In serving we recognize a simple, but powerful, truth: we need each other, and we must care for one another.', \"Today we do more than celebrate America, we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution, and renewed through two centuries of challenge, an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate, we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity, the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's journey long, heroic journey must go forever upward.\", 'And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st Century, let us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and let us work until our work is done.', 'The Scripture says: \"And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\"', 'From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley.', \"We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the guard, and now each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the call.\", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.', 'My fellow citizens: At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century.', 'It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs -- a moment that will define our course, and our character, for decades to come.', 'We must keep our old democracy forever young.', 'Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.', 'The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal.', 'It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.', 'Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century.', 'And what a century it has been.', \"America became the world's mightiest industrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.\", 'Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.', 'Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose.', 'We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast.', 'We began the 20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency.', 'Those choices made all the difference.', 'At the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect union.', 'When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today.', 'We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation.', 'In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement.', \"America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.\", 'Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth.', 'Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.', 'Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.', 'And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government.', 'Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution.', 'We -- the American people -- we are the solution.', 'Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.', 'As times change, so government must change.', 'We need a new government for a new century -- humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less.', 'Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less.', 'The preeminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity -- not a guarantee, but a real opportunity -- to build better lives.', 'Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us.', 'Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship.', 'And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century.', 'There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls; coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others.', 'Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility -- not only for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation.', 'Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century.', 'For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.', 'The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future -- will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not?', 'Will we all come together, or come apart?', \"The divide of race has been America's constant curse.\", 'And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices.', 'Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different.', 'These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past.', 'They plague us still.', 'They fuel the fanaticism of terror.', 'And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.', 'These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become.', 'We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere.', 'We shall overcome them.', 'And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.', 'Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st century.', 'Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together.', 'As this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines.', 'Ten years ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren.', 'Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life.', 'Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand.', 'The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps.', 'Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries.', 'Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over.', 'And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship.', 'My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy?', 'To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding \"Yes.\"', 'This is the heart of our task.', \"With a new vision of government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey.\", 'The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise.', \"In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession.\", 'Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy.', 'And the doors of higher education will be open to all.', 'The knowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just of the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child.', 'Parents and children will have time not only to work, but to read and play together.', 'And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college, \\n\\nOur streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore.', \"Everyone who can work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of tomorrow's growing middle class.\", 'New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and hardworking families too long denied.', 'We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction.', 'Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.', 'Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas.', \"And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies.\", 'Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations -- a nation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its values.', 'A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time.', \"A nation that fortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.\", 'And in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests -- regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans.', 'Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens.', 'Prosperity and power -- yes, they are important, and we must maintain them.', 'But let us never forget: The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest progress we have yet to make, is in the human heart.', \"In the end, all the world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit.\", 'Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation.', 'Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart.', \"Martin Luther King's dream was the American Dream.\", 'His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed.', 'Our history has been built on such dreams and labors.', 'And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century.', 'To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office.', 'I ask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge.', 'The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another.', 'Surely, they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.', \"No, they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with America's mission.\", 'America demands and deserves big things from us -- and nothing big ever came from being small.', 'Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin, when facing the end of his own life.', 'He said: \"It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on acrimony and division.\"', 'Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time.', 'For all of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too, will come to an end.', 'But the journey of our America must go on.', 'And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to dare.', 'The demands of our time are great and they are different.', 'Let us meet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful and happy heart.', 'Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history.', 'Yes, let us build our bridge.', 'A bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise.', \"May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American Dream alive for all her children; with the American promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people; with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world.\", 'From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth.', 'May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead -- and always, always bless our America.', 'President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.', 'With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.', 'As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.', 'And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.', \"I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.\", 'We have a place, all of us, in a long story--a story we continue, but whose end we will not see.', 'It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.', 'It is the American story--a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.', 'The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.', 'Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.', 'And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.', \"Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea.\", 'Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.', 'Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along.', 'And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.', 'While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country.', 'The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.', 'And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.', 'We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.', 'Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.', 'And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.', 'I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image.', 'And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.', 'America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.', 'We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens.', 'Every child must be taught these principles.', 'Every citizen must uphold them.', 'And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.', \"Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.\", 'America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.', 'A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.', 'Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.', 'But the stakes for America are never small.', 'If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.', 'If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism.', 'If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.', 'We must live up to the calling we share.', 'Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment.', 'It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.', 'And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.', 'America, at its best, is also courageous.', 'Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good.', 'Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.', 'We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.', \"Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.\", 'We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent.', 'And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.', 'We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.', 'We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.', 'The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.', 'We will defend our allies and our interests.', 'We will show purpose without arrogance.', 'We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.', 'And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.', 'America, at its best, is compassionate.', \"In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.\", 'And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.', 'Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love.', 'And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.', 'Where there is suffering, there is duty.', 'Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities.', 'And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.', 'Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools.', 'Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.', \"And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.\", 'Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.', 'Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.', 'And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.', 'America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.', 'Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience.', 'And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.', 'We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments.', 'And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.', 'Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.', 'Sometimes in life we are called to do great things.', 'But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love.', 'The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.', 'I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.', 'In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.', 'What you do is as important as anything government does.', 'I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.', 'I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.', 'Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.', 'When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it.', 'When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.', 'After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson: \"We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong.', 'Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?\"', 'Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration.', 'The years and changes accumulate.', \"But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courage

one another.', 'Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.', 'This work

ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.', 'I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.', 'At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together.', 'For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.', 'After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical¡Xand then there came a day of fire.', 'We have seen our vulnerability¡Xand we have seen its deepest source.', 'For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny¡Xprone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder¡Xviolence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat.', 'There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.', 'We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.', 'The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.', 'America¡¦s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.', 'From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth.', 'Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave.', 'Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation.', 'It is the honorable achievement of our fathers.', 'Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation¡¦s security, and the calling of our time.', 'So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.', 'This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.', 'Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.', 'And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.', 'America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling.', 'Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.', 'The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations.', 'The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.', 'America¡¦s influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America¡¦s influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom¡¦s cause.', 'My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats.', 'Some have unwisely chosen to test America¡¦s resolve, and have found it firm.', 'We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right.', 'America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.', 'We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people.', 'America¡¦s belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed.', 'In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.', 'Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty¡Xthough this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt.', 'Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals.', 'Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul.', 'We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery.', 'Liberty will come to those who love it.', 'Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:\\n  All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors.', 'When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.', 'Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country.', 'The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ¡§Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.¡¨\\n  The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them.', 'Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.', 'And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help.', 'Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom¡¦s enemies.', 'The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies¡¦ defeat.', 'Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:\\n  From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure.', 'Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon.', 'Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom.', 'And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it.', 'By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well¡Xa fire in the minds of men.', 'It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.', 'A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause¡Xin the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ¡K the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ¡K the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies.', 'Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives¡Xand we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.', 'All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time.', 'I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes.', 'You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers.', 'You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs.', 'Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself¡Xand in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.', 'America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home¡Xthe unfinished work of American freedom.', 'In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.', 'In America¡¦s ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence.', 'This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I.', 'Bill of Rights.', 'And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time.', 'To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society.', 'We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance¡Xpreparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society.', 'By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.', 'In America¡¦s ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character¡Xon integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives.', 'Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self.', 'That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people.', 'Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before¡Xideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.', 'In America¡¦s ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak.', 'Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.', 'Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love.', 'Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth.', 'And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.', 'From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many.', 'From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few.', 'Did our generation advance the cause of freedom?', 'And did our character bring credit to that cause?', 'These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom.', 'We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes¡Xand I will strive in good faith to heal them.', 'Yet those divisions do not define America.', 'We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart.', 'And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free.', 'We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom.', 'Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events.', 'Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills.', 'We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul.', 'When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ¡§Freedom Now¡¨¡Xthey were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.', 'History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.', 'When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ¡§It rang as if it meant something.¡¨ In our time it means something still.', 'America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof.', 'Renewed in our strength¡Xtested, but not weary¡Xwe are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.', 'May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.', 'My fellow citizens:\\n\\nI stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.', 'I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.', 'Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath.', 'The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.', 'Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.', 'At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.', 'So it has been.', 'So it must be with this generation of Americans.', 'That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.', 'Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.', 'Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.', 'Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.', 'Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.', 'These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.', \"Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.\", 'Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.', 'They are serious and they are many.', 'They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.', 'But know this, America -- they will be met.', 'On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.', 'On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.', 'We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.', 'The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.', 'In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.', 'It must be earned.', 'Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less.', 'It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.', \"Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things'some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.\", 'For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.', 'For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.', 'For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.', 'Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.', 'They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.', 'This is the journey we continue today.', 'We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.', 'Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.', 'Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.', 'Our capacity remains undiminished.', 'But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed.', 'Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.', 'For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.', 'The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.', 'We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.', \"We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.\", 'We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.', 'And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.', 'All this we can do.', 'All this we will do.', 'Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.', 'Their memories are short.', 'For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.', 'What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.', 'The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.', 'Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.', 'Where the answer is no, programs will end.', \"And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.\", 'Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control -- the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.', 'The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.', 'As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.', 'Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.', \"Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake.\", 'And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.', 'Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.', 'They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.', 'Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.', 'We are the keepers of this legacy.', 'Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.', 'We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.', 'With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet.', 'We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.', 'For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.', 'We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers.', 'We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.', 'To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.', \"To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.\", 'To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.', 'To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.', \"And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.\", 'For the world has changed, and we must change with it.', 'As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.', 'They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.', 'We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.', 'And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.', 'For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies.', 'It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.', \"It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.\", 'Our challenges may be new.', 'The instruments with which we meet them may be new.', 'But those values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old.', 'These things are true.', 'They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.', 'What is demanded then is a return to these truths.', 'What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.', 'This is the price and the promise of citizenship.', 'This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.', 'This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.', 'So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled.', \"In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.\", 'The capital was abandoned.', 'The enemy was advancing.', 'The snow was stained with blood.', 'At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:\\n\\n\"Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet ...', 'it.\"', 'America!', 'In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.', 'With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.', \"Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.\", 'Thank you.', 'God bless you.', 'And God bless the United States of America.']\n"
